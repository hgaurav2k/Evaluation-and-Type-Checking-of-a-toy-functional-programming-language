## Type-Checking and Evaluation of a toy functional programming language
# Course Project -- Programming Languages
This is a tool to scan, parse and evaluate expressions in an SML-esque programming language.
It has support for arithmetic, booleans, functions(higher-order, recursive). The input consists of parseable semi-colon separated expressions.\
The expressions are evaluated under the call by value paradigm.  \
Run make all to create the executable a3. \
Run ./a3 <filename> to get the parse-tree followed by the values of the expression in the program provided that the program is well-typed.
